    "# Why Part 2?\n",
    "If we noticed from the data we have from the previous post (Recommendation System Using (Rank, User-User, Matrix Factorization) on Streaming App). We have limited advantages from the dataset. Some of the examples we lack of is:\n",
    "* movie/tv year released to understand years' trends\n",
    "* full-content details such as overviews of the content would help us in applying content-based recommendations\n",
    "* more tags of genre because we know each content can have more genre\n",
    "* metrics of each content such as ratings, votes, and reviews. These can help identify which content has more value. Since STC did not add their ratings, we cannot conclude local popularity by using ratings because these ratings were collected globally from TMDB. Therefore, we can add ratings globally. For example, \"Most Voted Movies Globally\""

    "In the previous article, I had planned to add a content-based recommendation system but unfortunately, that was not possible due to a lack of data points from STC that can help us to apply the content-based recommendation. In this article, our main goal is to make that happen by feeding our data with another source of data using TMDB OpenSource API. This will help us fetch required data points such as release date, overview, and genre."
